Effective color palettes are instrumental in crafting visually captivating and meaningful designs.</p> <h3 id="color-theory"><a href="#color-theory" class="header-anchor">#</a> Color Theory</h3> <p>Color theory today is primarily based on Isaac Newton's colour wheel, which he established in 1666. The main colour wheel illustrates three colour categories: primary colours, secondary colours, and tertiary colours. Let’s understand it...</p> <p><strong>Primary colors</strong> are those that cannot be produced by mixing two or more other colors. Red, blue, and yellow are the main colors.</p> <p>The <strong>secondary colors</strong> are orange, purple, and green, which may be created by mixing any two of the three basic colors.</p> <p><strong>Tertiary colors</strong> are created when you combine a main and a secondary color. Magenta, vermillion, violet, teal, amber, and chartreuse are the tertiary hues.</p> <div title="Beginning Graphic Design: Color" class="video-player"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2LLXnUdUIc?si=49DeBHq2p6bInb7G" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h3 id="the-60-30-10-color-rule"><a href="#the-60-30-10-color-rule" class="header-anchor">#</a> The 60-30-10 Color Rule</h3> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/60-30-10.a518617b.png" alt="60-30-10 Color Rule"></p> <p>A popular approach to achieving color balance is the 60-30-10 rule, often associated with the notion of a Golden Ratio in design. This rule suggests that:</p> <ul><li>A neutral color for <strong>60%</strong> of your design</li> <li>A secondary brand color for <strong>30%</strong></li> <li><strong>10%</strong> in your UI design should be your main brand color</li></ul> <p>Effective UI design leverages this rule to achieve an impeccable color coordination, enhancing the user's interaction with the design.</p> <h3 id="example-of-60-30-10-color-rule-in-a-mobile-app"><a href="#example-of-60-30-10-color-rule-in-a-mobile-app" class="header-anchor">#</a> Example of 60-30-10 Color Rule in a Mobile App</h3> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/example-colours.3729018d.png" alt="Example Colour Scheme"></p> <p><strong>Dominant Color (60%) - Light Lavender:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Usage:</strong> Ideal for backgrounds and large UI elements. This light lavender (<code>#F4F5FD</code>) offers a clean, calming, and modern backdrop that's easy on the eyes.</li> <li><strong>Hex Code:</strong> <code>#F4F5FD</code></li></ul> <p><strong>Secondary Color (30%) - Deep Slate:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Usage:</strong> For text, headers, footers, and less prominent buttons. Deep slate (<code>#384258</code>) provides a strong contrast against the light lavender, adding depth and sophistication to the design.</li> <li><strong>Hex Code:</strong> <code>#384258</code></li></ul> <p><strong>Accent Color (10%) - Vibrant Purple:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Usage:</strong> For call-to-action buttons, highlights, and key interactive elements.

Unlike a meticulous reading, users often scan a page to quickly ascertain if the information they need is present. Here, well-organized and scannable typography can capture and hold the users' attention.</p> <p>Once engaged, clear and informative typographic design is crucial for providing precise information about the products or services offered, nudging the users toward making a purchase.</p> <p>The importance of typography in UI design is indispensable and should never be overlooked.</p> <h3 id="the-benefits-of-good-typography"><a href="#the-benefits-of-good-typography" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Benefits of Good Typography</h3> <p>Beyond being a medium of visual communication, good typography in website or mobile app design offers numerous advantages:</p> <ol><li><strong>Enhanced Readability and Accessibility</strong>: Good typography facilitates easier reading, scanning, and navigation across the page, thereby reducing the time users take to find the information they need.</li> <li><strong>Consistent Tone and Mood</strong>: The choice of typeface sets the general tone or atmosphere across interfaces. For instance, a cartoon font with warm colors and bold strokes adds a fun, personalized touch, whereas a simple and serious typography sets a more formal tone.</li> <li><strong>Distinctive UI Identity</strong>: Like other elements in UI design, high-quality typography has a professional allure and aligns with the brand's vision, color, and concept, helping your UI stand out from the crowd.</li> <li><strong>Boosted Product Sales</strong>: Effective typographic design keeps users on your UI longer and facilitates easy access to necessary information, indirectly boosting sales by reducing user distractions.</li></ol> <h3 id="styling-typography-to-suit-your-purpose"><a href="#styling-typography-to-suit-your-purpose" class="header-anchor">#</a> Styling Typography to Suit Your Purpose</h3> <p><strong>Bold and Italic</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Common typographic styles like italic and bold help emphasize text. Bold is great for headlines and crucial text areas, while italics are often used for foreign words or reference links.</li></ul> <p><strong>Typeface Families</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Some typefaces offer a range of styles. For example, Futura has 22 different styles including light, condensed, semi-bold, and extra bold, providing versatile options for different design needs.</li></ul> <p><strong>Novelty Styles</strong>:</p> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/novelty-typeface.6457ee6b.png" alt="Novelty Font"></p> <ul><li>Novelty styles add a unique flair but should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the design.</li></ul> <h3 id="crafting-an-effective-typography-design"><a href="#crafting-an-effective-typography-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Crafting an Effective Typography Design</h3> <p>With a grasp of typography types and manipulations, here are 10 best practices to achieve compelling typography design:</p> <ol><li><strong>Choosing Typefaces</strong>: Selecting the right typefaces is fundamental. Choose a typeface that aligns with your brand's personality and the overall design aesthetics of your UI. It's often advisable to pair a serif and a sans-serif typeface to create a balanced look.</li> <li><strong>Selecting Font-Weight and Styles</strong>: The weight and style of the font can significantly impact the look and feel of your design. Bold weights are excellent for headlines, while regular or light weights are suitable for body text. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for your design.</li> <li><strong>Mind the Spacing</strong>: Adequate spacing between letters, words, and lines improves readability and aesthetics. Use kerning, tracking, and leading effectively to achieve a well-spaced typography design.</li> <li><strong>Establish a Clear Visual Hierarchy</strong>: Visual hierarchy guides the reader's eye and helps them navigate the content easily. Create a clear hierarchy using different font sizes, weights, and colors for headings, subheadings, and body text.</li> <li><strong>Ensure Scalability</strong>: Your typography should remain effective and legible across various screen sizes and resolutions. Use scalable units like ems or rems for font sizes to ensure a responsive design.</li> <li><strong>Utilize Visual Contrast Judiciously</strong>: Contrast helps in distinguishing text and improves readability. Ensure there's enough contrast between your text and background, but avoid overly harsh contrasts as they can be straining to the eyes.</li> <li><strong>Keep Text Simple and Concise</strong>: Clear and straightforward text is key to effective communication. Avoid jargon and keep your sentences short and to the point.</li> <li><strong>Maintain Consistency</strong>: Consistency in typography creates a cohesive look and improves the user experience. Stick to a defined set of typefaces and styles throughout your design.</li> <li><strong>Animate Your Copy Wisely</strong>: Animation can add a dynamic flair to your typography, but it should be used sparingly. Ensure animations enhance rather than distract from your message.</li> <li><strong>Prototyping and Testing</strong>: Before finalizing your typography design, prototype and test it with real users to gather feedback. Testing helps in understanding how your typography performs across different devices and under various use cases, allowing you to make necessary adjustments for an optimal user experience.</li></ol> <h2 id="iconography"><a href="#iconography" class="header-anchor">#</a> Iconography</h2> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/icon-banner.025d00b2.png" alt="Iconography Pallet Banner"></p> <p>Icons play a pivotal role in UI design, serving as visual cues that convey information quickly and efficiently to users.

It allows for the efficient use and reuse of icons across different designs, ensuring consistency and saving time. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating icon components in Figma:</p> <h4 id="step-1-prepare-your-icons"><a href="#step-1-prepare-your-icons" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 1: Prepare Your Icons</h4> <ol><li><strong>Design or Import Icons</strong>: Start by designing your icons in Figma or importing them from other sources. Ensure they are vector graphics for scalability and editing flexibility.</li> <li><strong>Standardize Sizes</strong>: Make sure all icons are of a consistent size. Common sizes are 24x24 or 32x32 pixels, but this can vary based on your design system.</li> <li><strong>Optimize for Pixel-Perfect Rendering</strong>: Align your icons to the pixel grid to avoid blurry edges. This is particularly important for small-sized icons.</li></ol> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/icon-grid.b5316bc5.png" alt="Icon Grid"> <a href="https://m2.material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#grid-and-keyline-shapes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more about icon grid here<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <h4 id="step-2-create-components"><a href="#step-2-create-components" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 2: Create Components</h4> <ol><li><strong>Select an Icon</strong>: Click on the icon you want to turn into a component.</li> <li><strong>Create the Component</strong>: Use the keyboard shortcut <code>Cmd + Alt + K</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl + Alt + K</code> (Windows) to create a component. Alternatively, you can right-click on the icon and select 'Create Component'.</li> <li><strong>Name Your Component</strong>: Give your component a clear and descriptive name.

With a modular approach to designing interfaces, components can be utilized within the same project multiple times or across different projects. Once a master component is created, its instances can be placed anywhere within a design. Crucially, any updates made to the master component are automatically reflected across all its instances, ensuring uniformity and consistency throughout your design work. This is especially beneficial for frequently used elements such as buttons, icons, headers, and footers, allowing for their seamless integration across different screens or projects.</p> <h3 id="benefits-of-components"><a href="#benefits-of-components" class="header-anchor">#</a> Benefits of Components</h3> <ul><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Components ensure that your design elements remain uniform across your project, which is crucial for maintaining a cohesive look and feel.</li> <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: They significantly reduce the time and effort required to make global updates. Changing a single component updates all instances where that component is used.</li> <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Once a component is created, it can be reused in any number of designs, saving time and fostering a modular design approach.</li> <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Components make it easier to scale your designs. As projects grow, components can be easily managed and updated, ensuring that large projects remain manageable.</li></ul> <h3 id="difference-between-components-and-frames"><a href="#difference-between-components-and-frames" class="header-anchor">#</a> Difference Between Components and Frames</h3> <p>While both components and frames are essential elements within Figma, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:</p> <ul><li><strong>Frames</strong>: Frames are containers that can hold other objects, including shapes, text, and even other frames. They are used to structure the layout of your design, such as creating the canvas for a webpage or defining the boundaries of a mobile app screen. Frames can also be nested within each other to create complex layouts.</li> <li><strong>Components</strong>: Unlike frames, components are defined by their reusability and the ability to ensure consistency across designs. Components can contain frames, but they come with the added benefit of being instances that are linked back to a master component. This linkage allows for the central management of design elements, where changes to the master component are reflected across all instances.</li></ul> <h2 id="creating-and-editing-components"><a href="#creating-and-editing-components" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating and Editing Components</h2> <div title="Figma Tutorial: Components - The Basics" class="video-player"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k74IrUNaJVk?si=h0GvncQBVj2Bft21" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h2 id="creating-component-variants"><a href="#creating-component-variants" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating Component Variants</h2> <div title="Figma Tutorial: Variants" class="video-player"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y29Xwt9dET0?si=RTlkMvLZ1HU-A2T0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h2 id="creating-components-like-a-developer"><a href="#creating-components-like-a-developer" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating Components Like a Developer</h2> <p>In our previous discussions on Auto-layout, we drew parallels between Figma's Auto-layout feature and the flexbox property in CSS, illustrating how Figma's design capabilities can mirror web development practices. This analogy extends beyond Auto-layout into other facets of component creation in Figma.</p> <p>Take the example of implementing a hover effect on a card that triggers the display of a new element. In web development, this effect is usually achieved by incorporating the element in the initial markup but keeping it hidden with CSS until the user hovers over the card. We apply a similar strategy when creating components in Figma. The base component is designed to include the hover state's elements from the start. These elements are then visually hidden or made inactive in the default variant and are only revealed or activated in the hover state variant. This approach not only streamlines the design process but also aligns closely with the logic and practices used in front-end development, facilitating a more cohesive workflow between design and development teams.</p> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/component-code.45236857.png" alt="Component vs Code"></p> <h2 id="nesting-components"><a href="#nesting-components" class="header-anchor">#</a> Nesting Components</h2> <p>Nesting components in Figma is a technique that involves placing one component inside another. This approach is instrumental in building more complex and dynamic design systems, allowing designers to create detailed and highly customizable interfaces. By mastering nested components, designers can significantly enhance their workflow efficiency and design consistency.</p> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/nested-icon-components.dd88cdd9.png" alt="Nested Components"></p> <h3 id="benefits-of-nesting-components"><a href="#benefits-of-nesting-components" class="header-anchor">#</a> Benefits of Nesting Components</h3> <ul><li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Nesting components promotes a modular design approach, making it easier to assemble, disassemble, and reconfigure parts of your design.</li> <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> It allows your design system to grow more seamlessly. As new components are needed, they can be created by combining existing ones, saving time and effort.</li> <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Updates to base components automatically propagate to all instances where they are nested, streamlining the process of making global changes.</li> <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures design consistency across projects by reusing components, reducing the risk of discrepancies.</li></ul> <h3 id="how-to-create-and-manage-nested-components"><a href="#how-to-create-and-manage-nested-components" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to Create and Manage Nested Components</h3> <ol><li><strong>Start Simple:</strong> Begin by creating your base components. These are the smallest, most atomic parts of your design (e.g., icons, buttons).</li> <li><strong>Combine Components:</strong> To create a nested component, drag an existing component into another component. Figma automatically recognizes this as nesting.</li> <li><strong>Use Variants:</strong> Leverage variants to manage different states or types of nested components, keeping them organized and accessible.</li> <li><strong>Organize and Document:</strong> Use Figma’s naming conventions and team libraries to organize your nested components. Documentation helps your team understand how and when to use each component.</li> <li><strong>Review and Refine:</strong> Regularly review your nested components to ensure they remain efficient and effective. Simplify or decompose them as needed.</li></ol> <h2 id="libraries-for-ui-in-figma"><a href="#libraries-for-ui-in-figma" class="header-anchor">#</a> Libraries for UI in Figma</h2> <p>Figma libraries are especially useful for UI design as they allow for the consistent application of design patterns across different screens and projects.</p> <div title="Figma tutorial: Create a shareable team library" class="video-player"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79T8Q6OBmRk?si=_IkxRjfrfLfE4AnQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h2 id="engaging-with-the-figma-community-for-ui-inspiration"><a href="#engaging-with-the-figma-community-for-ui-inspiration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Engaging with the Figma Community for UI Inspiration</h2> <p><img src="/course-site/assets/img/figma-community.7e2ae0a0.png" alt="Figma Community Banner"></p> <p>The Figma Community is a rich resource for UI designers, offering access to a wide range of UI design templates and UI kits.</p> <h3 id="benefits-of-the-figma-community-for-ui-designers"><a href="#benefits-of-the-figma-community-for-ui-designers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Benefits of the Figma Community for UI Designers:</h3> <ol><li><strong>UI Templates</strong>: Find and use templates specifically created for UI designs.</li> <li><strong>Learning from Experts</strong>: Follow leading UI designers to learn from their designs and workflows.</li> <li><strong>Sharing and Feedback</strong>: Share your UI designs to get feedback and suggestions from the community.</li></ol> <p>By focusing on these aspects, you can effectively use Figma to create, manage, and share UI design components and assets, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">7/18/2024, 2:39:40 PM</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
